Any format, recommended to be generated by Administrator/MasterAgent with a format: Recommended to include at least the following content:

- Operator
- Operation Time
- Operation Content
- Operation Result: (It is recommended to specify the operation result after the Agent fails a specified number of times and guide the Agent to build a module from scratch from a new perspective ---> This is usually effective for when the Agent always fails to solve a certain problem.)

Project-level Logs are recommended to be administrator operation records, such as modifying code, modifying configuration files, modifying environment variables, etc., which are usually difficult for Agents to perceive.

If the modified content can be tracked by git, it can also be handed over to MasterAgent to generate records.
