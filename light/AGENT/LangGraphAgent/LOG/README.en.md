name: LangGraphAgent's Operation Log
description: |
    Here is the operation log of LangGraphAgent. As the project progresses, LangGraphAgent must update its operation log according to the project's requirements and progress.
    The update of the operation log must not have information loss caused by overwriting. If any error or exception information is encountered during an attempt, these will also be recorded as LangGraphAgent's experience. This allows for a quick reaction when relevant exceptions are identified next time.
